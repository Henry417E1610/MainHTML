    <h1>Shido Itsuka</h1>
    <p>
        Shido is the main character in Date A Live, he possesses a strange power that allows 
        him to seal the powers of a Spirit in his body with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since he has this type of power, whenever a Spirit appears, he has to do everything (with assistance 
        by Kotori and sometimes the other Spirits) to save and support her, so that she'll be able to build better 
        relationship with him. And among all the options, the safest and most convenient way for him is to date 
        with her.
