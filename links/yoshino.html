    <h1>Yoshino Himekawa</h1>
    <p>
        Yoshino is the second Spirit in Date A Live, a cute little girl with a bunny puppet on her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        She is usually very shy, with difficulties expressing herself, instead, her puppet, Yoshinon, is always speaking 
        out for her. But after she was saved by <a href="./shido.html">Shido</a>, she started to improve her communication skills gradually, without 
        relying on Yoshinon.
